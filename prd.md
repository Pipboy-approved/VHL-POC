Section 1.0 Overview

We create a web aplication that is Single Page Application (SPA).

- Application name is "VHL portal"
- The application is a Vite app with React and Typescript that uses only raw CSS for styling.

Important! Every time before You make changes, confirm that these comply with prd.md
Important! If there are conflicts or uncertainties - ask clarifying questions or suggest changes before changing anything.

Section 1.1 File structure and components in application

File structure:
- All CSS should be in one file called styles.css and this should reside in root directory
-- In CSS use for colours only hex notation and convert colors to 3 alphanumeric codes. Samples: #333; #f6A; #BD3 etc.

All CSS in styles.css should be sorted as follows.
1) Styles by Tags, sorted alphanumerically
2) Styles by classes, sorted alphanumerically
2) Styles by IDÂ´s, sorted alphanumerically

Components
- The app spans across the screen of browser.
