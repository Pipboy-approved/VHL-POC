We create a web plication that is Single Page Application (SPA).

The application is a Vite app with React and Typescript.

App itself will be initiated in file called index.html which has necessary paths and callbacks to required files.

After solution creation it should be uploaded to Github https://github.com/Pipboy-approved/fit

File structure:
- All CSS should be in one file called styles.css and this should reside in root directory
-- In CSS use for colours only hex notation and convert colors to 3 alphanumeric codes. Samples: #333; #f6A; #BD3 etc.
- All Typescript should reside in \src folder
- index.html should reside in root directory
